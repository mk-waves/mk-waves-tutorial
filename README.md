# Making Waves Tutorial

<font color='green'>This tutorial provides an overview of steps taken to download, visualize, and evaluate data from Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) buoy stations. The tutorial also provides an overview of how to download and use El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center. The two datasets are then used to calculate sea surface temperature anomalies and build a linear regression model to compare correlations with ENSO behavior at a specific location.</font>

<font color='green'>The following tasks are included in this tutorial:
1. Read in data
2. Display metadata
3. View data
4. Clean data
5. Visualize data
6. Create new dataframes aggregated by monthly means
7. Calculate anolalies from hisoric records
8. Join dataframes
9. Model data using linear regression to evaluate correlations between variables</font>
